        <p id="prTex">Mostly when we are learning a new thing, we can often get a bit anxious about the amount of information we find.
            This is because there are a LOT of shortcuts and commands in the various tools we need to learn.
            And we still need to master and use all of this while we're learning and building even bigger things.</p>

        <p id="prTex">The goal here is to have a simple page to compile a variety of sources of tips and techniques from the internet.
            This allows us to easily identify what really matters. We can then gradually learn and use those more important commands
            until it becomes natural, giving us more time and energy to focus on what really matters right now.</p>
