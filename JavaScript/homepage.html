        <p id="t1">Mostly at the beginning, we can often get a bit anxious about the amount of tools and information we find.
            This is because there are lots of shortcuts in the various tools, lots of terminal commands.
            We need to master and use all this while we're learning even bigger things.</p>

        <p id="t1">The goal here is to compile a variety of sources of tips and techniques from the internet.
            This allows us to easily identify what really matters. We can then gradually learn and use those commands
            until it becomes natural, giving us more time and energy to focus on what is really critical right now.</p>
