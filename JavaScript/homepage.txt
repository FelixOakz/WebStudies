Recall also that by opening Developer Tools in Google Chrome, you can simulate visiting your page on a mobile device by clicking
    the phone-shaped icon to the left of Elements in the developer tools window, or, once the Developer Tools tab has already been opened,
        by typing Ctrl+Shift+M on a PC or Cmd+Shift+M on a Mac, rather than needing to visit your site on a mobile device separately!
